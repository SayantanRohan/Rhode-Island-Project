# Rhode-Island-Project
This is a Data Analytics project where I performed different Data Analytics tasks using Pandas library in Python including data cleaning, data visualization and exploratory data analysis on the Rhode Island Dataset from the Stanford Open Policing Project and extracted many useful information from the Data.
